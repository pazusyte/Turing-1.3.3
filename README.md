# Turing-1.3.3

Have a list with a deck of 52 cards:
  Rank (highâ†’low):	Ace King Queen Jack 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
  Symbols: hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs

Randomize and divide the list into two hands, one for the program, one for the player.

Display to the player how many cards do they have.

Player can place a card with 'enter' and the program places a card at the same time.

Both cards are displayed with a message of who won.

Display to the player the updated amount of cards that they have.

Repeat lines 11 through 15.

If the player and the computer places the same rank of card, display that they go into war:
  the player is prompted to place another card, the program places a card, but these cards are not shown.
  the player is prompted again to place a card, the program places a card, these cards are shown, the higher one wins.
  if there is a tie again, war is repeated.
  if a player or the program run out of cards while in war, they automatically lose.

When war is over, if the player and the program still have cards, continue lines 11 through 15.

The first one to run out of cards loses, display a message to the player determining if they won or lost.
